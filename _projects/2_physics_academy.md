Inspired by Circuit Box, Physics Academy is an online learning platform offering interactive lessons as a means to demonstrate abstract concepts in physics. Physics Academy was founded on the simple premise that it's best to learn by doing.

Physics Academy was a finalist entry in the 2012 Columbia Venture Competition.
